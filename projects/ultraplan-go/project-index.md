# Project Index: ultraplan-go

> Project: `ultraplan-go`
> Purpose: available governance, evidence, and reasoning pool for UltraPlan Go implementation.

## Project Scope

- **Project Slug:** `ultraplan-go`
- **Repository:** `../ultraplan-go/`
- **Target Implementation Directory:** `/home/antonioborgerees/coding/ultraplan-go`
- **Primary Goal:** Build a production-grade Go CLI for UltraPlan study workflows and governed project/sprint planning through `plan.md`.
- **Phase 1 Goal:** Study initialization, source analysis, synthesis, code-reference extraction, resumable orchestration, validation, and diagnostics.
- **Phase 2 Goal:** Project cataloging plus sprint planning artifacts: `requirements.md`, `sprint-index.md`, `technical-handbook.md`, `reasoning/*.md`, `reasoning.md`, `plan.md`, and `flow-state.json`.
- **Non-Goals:** Sprint implementation execution, smoke investigation, review automation, issue tracking, hosted SaaS, browser UI, multi-user collaboration, and automatic Git mutation are explicitly deferred per PRD.

## Source Documents

| Document | Path | Summary |
|---|---|---|
| Product Requirements | `.ultra/projects/ultraplan-go/docs/PRD.md` | Product goals, user scenarios, command surface, study workflows, planning workflows through `plan`, validation, and launch criteria. |
| Technical Requirements | `.ultra/projects/ultraplan-go/docs/TRD.md` | Go architecture, workspace/config/runtime/state/validation requirements, project/sprint planning requirements, agentwrap integration, testing requirements. |
| Architecture | `.ultra/projects/ultraplan-go/docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` | Module-driven package layout and dependency rules for `study`, `project`, `sprint`, `workspace`, `codeextract`, and platform packages. |

## Active Contract Pool

Contracts are selected per sprint and applied through the phase gates in `roadmap.md`. A contract being in the active pool does not mean every production requirement blocks every skeleton sprint.

| Contract | Path | Applies To | Selection Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Architecture | `.ultra/system/contracts/core/architecture.md` | All sprints | Module ownership, dependency direction, thin entrypoints, product/platform separation. |
| Errors | `.ultra/system/contracts/core/errors.md` | All implementation sprints | Broad error categories, wrapping, actionable CLI diagnostics, exit codes, task failures. |
| Configuration | `.ultra/system/contracts/core/configuration.md` | Workspace/config/runtime config sprints | Config precedence, command preflight validation, redaction, runtime mapping. |
| Observability | `.ultra/system/contracts/core/observability.md` | Runtime, run-loop, status, logs | Events, diagnostics, structured logs, run/task metadata, health/preflight truthfulness. |
| Security | `.ultra/system/contracts/core/security.md` | Runtime execution, paths, permissions | Workspace path safety, secret redaction, subprocess/runtime policy, source isolation. |
| Testing | `.ultra/system/contracts/core/testing.md` | All implementation sprints | Unit/fixture/fake-runtime/gated integration expectations. |
| Documentation | `.ultra/system/contracts/core/documentation.md` | CLI/help/artifact docs | Generated docs, user-facing help, maintainable artifacts. |
| CLI Surface | `.ultra/system/contracts/surfaces/cli.md` | CLI command sprints | Command shape, flags, help, exit codes, JSON/text output. |
| LLM Runtime | `.ultra/system/contracts/runtime/llm.md` | Agentwrap/OpenCode integration | Runtime behavior, provider/model boundaries, adapter use. |
| LLM Evaluation / Cost / Safety | `.ultra/system/contracts/runtime/llm-evaluation-cost-safety.md` | Runtime execution/validation | Cost metadata, safety, evaluation discipline. |
| Workflows | `.ultra/system/contracts/runtime/workflows.md` | Run-loop, orchestration, retries | Stateful batch/workflow execution, retries, cancellation, resumability. |
| Performance | `.ultra/system/contracts/runtime/performance.md` | Scheduler/concurrency/report processing | Bounded workers, startup latency, repository scans, large artifact handling. |
| Persistence And Migrations | `.ultra/system/contracts/runtime/persistence-and-migrations.md` | Run state/workspace artifacts | Atomic file writes, durable format versions, compatibility and migrations. |

## Phase 2 Planning Context

Planning-side sprints should select only the contracts and evidence needed for the artifact stage being implemented. The phase workflow is:

```text
study -> select -> distill -> reason -> plan
```

Planning-side modules must follow these ownership rules:

- `internal/project` owns project docs and `project-index.md` catalog behavior.
- `internal/sprint` owns planning artifacts and `flow-state.json` through `plan.md`.
- `internal/study` remains independent and does not become a shared planning abstraction.
- `internal/platform/runtime` remains generic prompt execution infrastructure.

Phase 2 may reuse workspace discovery, config/redaction, command output conventions, generic runtime execution, and atomic file/JSON writes. It must not abstract study services, source/dimension models, report validation, rating parsing, summary generation, or run-loop scheduling for planning.

## Prior Decisions

None yet — this is the first project.

## Review Protocols

| Protocol | Path | Required When |
|---|---|---|
| Architecture Review | `.ultra/system/protocols/architecture-review-protocol.md` | Package layout, dependency boundaries, runtime/module separation |
| Sprint Review | `.ultra/system/protocols/sprint-review-protocol.md` | Every completed sprint |
| Deep Smoke Sprint | `.ultra/system/protocols/deep-smoke-sprint-protocol.md` | Completed sprints that need real-runtime smoke evidence |

## Maintenance Notes

- Keep this index as a catalog, not a sprint plan.
- All 15 go-cli-study reports are available — select only the ones relevant to the sprint's scope via `sprint-index.md`.
- Reasoning templates are added on-demand, not upfront. Start with Architecture only.
- Planning-side sprints may implement project and sprint artifact workflows through `plan.md`.
- Do not implement sprint execution, smoke investigation, review automation, issue tracking, or automatic Git mutation in the product — PRD and TRD explicitly defer them. External smoke harnesses may still be cataloged here as evidence sources.
- TRD requires `github.com/Antonio7098/agentwrap` and `agentwrap/opencode` as the runtime SDK. Do not invent competing runtime contracts.
