## Decisions To Execute

| Decision | Source Section | Execution Implication |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Study-owned validation result model | `reasoning.md#decision-1-study-owned-validation-result-model` | Add or extend typed validation result structures in `/home/antonioborgerees/coding/ultraplan-go/internal/study/domain.go`; include schema/result version, overall status, summary counts, check name/ID, status, severity, path, expected condition, observed safe detail, guidance, source/dimension/run-state context where applicable, and redacted diagnostics. |
| Runtime-free study validation command | `reasoning.md#decision-2-runtime-free-study-validation-command` | Add thin CLI wiring in `/home/antonioborgerees/coding/ultraplan-go/internal/app/study_commands.go` for `ultraplan study <study> validate` and `--json`; implement orchestration in `/home/antonioborgerees/coding/ultraplan-go/internal/study/validation_command.go`; do not invoke runtime, network, source cloning, prompts, synthesis, repair, retry, fallback, or subprocess paths. |
| Stable JSON envelope in `internal/app` | `reasoning.md#decision-3-stable-json-envelope-in-internalapp` | Add `/home/antonioborgerees/coding/ultraplan-go/internal/app/json_output.go` as a payload-agnostic renderer for `schema_version`, `command`, `workspace`, `status`, `generated_at`, and `result`; keep command-specific schema fields in owning payloads. |
| Status JSON from durable local state | `reasoning.md#decision-4-status-json-from-durable-local-state` | Extend `ultraplan study <study> status --json` in `/home/antonioborgerees/coding/ultraplan-go/internal/app/study_commands.go`; summarize durable/local state, task counts, locks, run metadata, validation summaries, retry/fallback/cancellation metadata, artifacts, and unknown usage/cost without runtime invocation. |
| Health JSON through existing runtime health boundary | `reasoning.md#decision-5-health-json-through-existing-runtime-health-boundary` | Extend `/home/antonioborgerees/coding/ultraplan-go/internal/app/health_commands.go` with `--json`; use existing platform runtime/agentwrap health boundary and product-agnostic runtime summaries; do not import study semantics into platform runtime. |
| Redaction before text or JSON rendering | `reasoning.md#decision-6-redaction-before-text-or-json-rendering` | Update `/home/antonioborgerees/coding/ultraplan-go/internal/platform/config/redaction.go` or adjacent existing redaction policy so validation, status, and health diagnostics are safe before rendering; avoid secrets, prompt bodies, Markdown bodies, unsafe raw payload bytes, and full stderr. |
| Fake-first schema and behavior tests | `reasoning.md#decision-7-fake-first-schema-and-behavior-tests` | Add deterministic offline tests for validation service, validate command, status JSON, health JSON, redaction, exit codes, stable JSON fields, and no-runtime invocation; run required verification commands from `/home/antonioborgerees/coding/ultraplan-go`. |

## Requirements / Contracts To Satisfy

| Contract / Requirement ID | Required Behavior | Evidence Planned |
| --- | --- | --- |
| AC31, TRD 9A, TRD 15, Persistence And Migrations | Validation checks study structure, sources, dimensions, applicable per-source reports, final reports, `summary.csv`, and optional `studies/<study>/.ultraplan/run-state.json`; malformed or unsupported state is diagnosed, not migrated. | `internal/study/validation_command_test.go` fixtures for valid, missing, invalid, malformed, inapplicable, malformed state, and unsupported state cases. |
| AC32, TRD 9A.3, PRD 2.5.1 | Inapplicable Markdown source/dimension pairs are skipped or reported as inapplicable, not missing failures. | Validation tests for Markdown frontmatter applicability and status/summary behavior. |
| AC33, AC43, Errors, Observability | Failures include check name, severity, artifact path where applicable, expected condition, observed safe detail, and corrective guidance. | Validation model tests and command output tests assert structured fields and guidance. |
| AC34, TRD 7.2, CLI Surface | Validation returns exit code `0` when checks pass and exit code `5` for validation failures while preserving other error categories. | `internal/app/study_validate_commands_test.go` asserts exit codes and distinct non-validation behavior. |
| AC35, C66, LLM Runtime, Performance | Validation and status do not invoke agentwrap, OpenCode, network, source cloning, runtime execution, synthesis, repair, prompt generation, retry, fallback, or subprocess paths. | Command tests with nil/fake runtime seams assert no runtime invocation; import/package review. |
| AC36-40, AC42, TRD 7.3, Documentation, CLI Surface | `validate --json`, `status --json`, and `health --json` emit parseable, ANSI-free JSON with stable envelope fields and deterministic text behavior. | Command tests parse JSON and assert envelope/result fields, no ANSI, no mixed human text, and updated help text. |
| AC37, AC41, AC43, Configuration, Security | Health JSON includes stable health-check IDs/statuses, runtime/config/workspace summaries, redacted diagnostics, and guidance. | `internal/app/health_commands_test.go` covers success/failure, runtime-health diagnostics, schema fields, guidance, and redaction. |
| AC38, C68, Workflows, LLM Evaluation / Cost / Safety | Status JSON exposes run counts, task summaries, locks, validation summaries, retry/fallback metadata, run metadata, and unknown usage/cost as unknown/null/known flags, never invented zero. | `internal/app/study_status_commands_test.go` parses JSON and asserts counts, metadata, locks, validation summaries, and unknown usage/cost representation. |
| AC41, C69-70, Security | All visible diagnostics are redacted before text or JSON rendering; paths prefer workspace-relative output. | Redaction tests seed API-key-like, env/config secret, runtime stderr, prompt, and Markdown-like body values and assert absence. |
| AC45-46, Architecture | Study behavior remains in `internal/study`, command parsing/rendering in `internal/app`, runtime product-agnostic in `internal/platform/runtime`; no global `internal/validation`, `internal/reports`, `internal/diagnostics`, `internal/status`, or workflow-engine package. | Architecture Review protocol, import/package review, and implementation diff review. |
| AC47-49, Testing | Offline tests, race tests, and CLI build pass. | `go test ./...`, `go test -race ./...`, and `go build ./cmd/ultraplan` from `/home/antonioborgerees/coding/ultraplan-go`. |

  - [x] Use explicit statuses for pass, fail, warning, skipped, and inapplicable where needed by validation/status JSON.
  - [x] Keep the model study-owned and avoid app-local duplicates of study semantics.

- [x] **Task 3: Implement Study Validation Service**

## Verification Commands

| Check | Command | Expected Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Offline unit and command tests | `go test ./...` | Passes from `/home/antonioborgerees/coding/ultraplan-go` without OpenCode, provider credentials, network access, source cloning, or long sleeps. |
| Race verification | `go test -race ./...` | Passes from `/home/antonioborgerees/coding/ultraplan-go`. |
| CLI build | `go build ./cmd/ultraplan` | Builds successfully from `/home/antonioborgerees/coding/ultraplan-go`. |

## Risks And Blockers

| Risk / Blocker | Source | Mitigation | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Existing report validators may be too task-specific to reuse directly. | `reasoning.md#assumptions-and-risks` | Reused existing per-report validators from `internal/study/validation.go`; added only bounded study orchestration. | mitigated |
| Existing status/run-state code may not expose enough metadata for JSON summaries. | `reasoning.md#assumptions-and-risks` | Reused `SummarizeRunState` and shaped app-owned JSON from durable `RunState` fields. | mitigated |
| Existing redaction policy may be string-oriented and insufficient for nested payloads. | `reasoning.md#assumptions-and-risks` | Added boundary redaction helpers for validation/status/health and expanded token-like marker detection. | mitigated |
| JSON schema vocabulary may become breaking once automation consumes it. | `reasoning.md#assumptions-and-risks` | Added envelope/result schema versions and command tests asserting public fields. | mitigated |
| Validation/status could accidentally invoke runtime through shared command factories. | `reasoning.md#assumptions-and-risks` | Added command tests that replace the runtime factory and assert validate/status do not invoke it. | mitigated |
| Safe diagnostics may omit details useful for debugging. | `reasoning.md#assumptions-and-risks` | Findings include check names, paths, expected/observed details, and guidance; raw payload/debug retention remains future scope. | carried forward |
| Unsupported run-state versions may frustrate users without migration. | `reasoning.md#assumptions-and-risks` | Validation emits unsupported-schema diagnostics and guidance without migration, as required. | mitigated |
| Area-specific architecture reasoning artifact is absent. | `reasoning.md#assumptions-and-risks` | Use final architecture decisions in `reasoning.md`; do not reopen architecture in implementation. | mitigated |
