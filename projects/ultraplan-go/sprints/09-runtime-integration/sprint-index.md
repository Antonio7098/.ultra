# Sprint Index: 09 Runtime Integration

> Project: `ultraplan-go`
> Sprint: `09-runtime-integration`
> Purpose: selected context for this sprint. Must be a subset of `.ultra/projects/ultraplan-go/project-index.md`.
> **Inputs Used:** `.ultra/projects/ultraplan-go/sprints/09-runtime-integration/requirements.md`, `.ultra/projects/ultraplan-go/project-index.md`, `.ultra/projects/ultraplan-go/docs/PRD.md`, `.ultra/projects/ultraplan-go/docs/TRD.md`, `.ultra/projects/ultraplan-go/docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, `.ultra/system/templates/sprint-index.md`

This document selects what must be read, distilled, reasoned through, or checked for this sprint. It does not make implementation decisions. All selections must come from the project index — no items may be included that are not listed in the project index.

## Sprint Scope

- **Sprint Goal:** Integrate UltraPlan's generic runtime boundary with `github.com/Antonio7098/agentwrap` and `agentwrap/opencode` so later study execution can use OpenCode through agentwrap wrappers, health checks, policies, validation, permissions, and events without UltraPlan reimplementing runtime supervision.
- **Planned Output:** Runtime integration sprint artifacts plus the platform runtime API, agentwrap/opencode composition, runtime health mapping, policy and permission mapping, event and diagnostics mapping, runtime config extensions, health command runtime wiring, and fake-runtime/config/health tests listed in the sprint requirements.
- **Depends On:** Sprints 1-8 carry forward CLI/app wiring, workspace/config/logging/health foundations, study metadata context without platform-runtime product imports, workspace and prompt locations, Markdown source applicability context, report validation hooks, prompt composition outputs, and run-state ID/task metadata placeholders. Runtime execution remained deferred in those prior outputs and enters scope only through the generic platform runtime boundary in this sprint.
- **Non-Goals:** Public study run, synthesize, run-all, run-loop, batch scheduling, durable workflow orchestration, per-study locks, stale-running recovery, active task cancellation, summary generation, code-reference extraction, target workflows, sprint planning, sprint execution, stable new public runtime JSON schemas, and any UltraPlan-owned OpenCode subprocess supervisor, native event decoder, retry engine, permission translator, or validation wrapper that duplicates agentwrap behavior.

## Selected Contracts

Each contract applies as a flat whole to this sprint. All paths must appear in the project index's "Active Contract Pool" table.

| Contract | Why Selected |
| ------------ | ------------ |
| Architecture | Governs module ownership, dependency direction, thin entrypoints, and the required `study -> platform/runtime -> agentwrap/opencode` separation. |
| Errors | Governs wrapped errors, actionable diagnostics, exit behavior, and preserving agentwrap `SDKError` classifications without string matching. |
| Configuration | Governs runtime config precedence, validation, mapping into agentwrap/opencode options, command preflight behavior, and redaction. |
| Observability | Governs canonical events, safe diagnostics, structured logs, runtime metadata, health truthfulness, usage/cost signals, and run/task correlation fields. |
| Security | Governs secret redaction, source/workspace path safety, sandbox and permission posture, and avoiding direct unsafe runtime process handling. |
| Testing | Governs fake-runtime coverage, fixture/unit tests, gated real-runtime smoke tests, and default test runs that do not require OpenCode or credentials. |
| CLI Surface | Governs `ultraplan health` runtime reporting, help/exit-code behavior, and stable human/script-facing output for health failures. |
| LLM Runtime | Governs agentwrap/OpenCode runtime boundary, provider/model handling, health checks, adapter use, wrapper composition, validation, policy, permissions, and events. |
| LLM Evaluation / Cost / Safety | Governs runtime validation discipline, safe usage/cost metadata, unknown usage handling, and safety around native payloads and diagnostics. |
| Workflows | Governs context propagation, cancellation semantics, retry/fallback ownership through agentwrap, and operational signals while full batch/run-loop workflow scope remains excluded. |

## Selected Reasoning Templates

All paths must appear in the project index's "Available Reasoning Templates" table.

| Template | Output Path | Why Selected |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------ |
| Architecture | `.ultra/projects/ultraplan-go/sprints/09-runtime-integration/reasoning/runtime-integration.md` | Required to reason through runtime/product separation, wrapper order, config mapping, permission posture, event/log mapping, test seams, and deferred study orchestration. |

## Prior Decisions To Carry Forward

All decision paths must appear in the project index's "Prior Decisions" table.

The project index lists no formal prior decisions, so no prior-decision artifacts are selected here. Carry-forward constraints from completed prior sprint outputs are recorded in Sprint Scope as dependencies from this sprint's requirements rather than as project-index decision records.

## Required Review Protocols

All paths must appear in the project index's "Review Protocols" table.

| Protocol | Path | Required Evidence |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| Architecture Review | `.ultra/system/protocols/architecture-review-protocol.md` | Evidence that runtime behavior remains generic in `internal/platform/runtime`, platform packages do not import product modules, and OpenCode execution is delegated through `agentwrap/opencode`. |
| Sprint Review | `.ultra/system/protocols/sprint-review-protocol.md` | Evidence that required sprint artifacts and implementation outputs exist, acceptance criteria are checked, verification commands are recorded, and carry-forward decisions are captured. |

## Excluded Context

| Context | Reason Excluded | Revisit If |
| ----------- | --------------- | ------------- |
| Public study execution commands | This sprint builds the runtime boundary and health wiring only; public `study run`, `synthesize`, `run-all`, and `run-loop` execution remains outside scope. | A later execution sprint selects study task orchestration scope. |
| Full Batch / Durable Workflow Gate scope | Worker pools, run-loop mutation, locks, stale-running recovery, and durable run stores are explicitly non-goals except for metadata compatibility with existing run-state placeholders. | Batch/run-loop execution enters scope. |
| Study report semantics inside `internal/platform/runtime` | Platform runtime must stay generic and expose validation hooks without importing study types or owning report rules. | Study execution wires product validators through the generic runtime boundary. |
| Summary generation | Summary writing and score aggregation are not part of runtime integration. | Summary generation sprint or study batch execution requires it. |
| Code reference extraction | Citation parsing and snippet extraction are not part of runtime integration. | Code extraction implementation or validation scope is selected. |
| Target workflows, sprint planning, and sprint execution | Project scope and sprint requirements defer target and sprint workflows. | Project requirements are revised to include target/sprint behavior. |
| Stable new public runtime JSON schemas | Sprint requirements do not require new stable public JSON schemas for runtime status or health unless already present. | A public JSON output contract is selected and documented. |
| Direct OpenCode process supervision or native decoding by UltraPlan | Agentwrap/opencode owns process launch, stdout/stderr handling, native event projection, retry/fallback, permissions, health, validation, and diagnostics. | Agentwrap cannot represent a required runtime behavior and a reviewed exception is recorded. |
| `09-terminal-ux` evidence report | Health output must be actionable, but this sprint is primarily runtime integration rather than terminal UX design. | A sprint focuses on progress output, TUI behavior, or terminal formatting. |
| `14-performance` evidence report | Broad performance tuning, scheduler throughput, and large artifact handling are not central to this sprint's generic runtime boundary. | Batch scheduling, large-run status, or repository-scan performance enters scope. |
| Performance contract | Scheduler/concurrency/report-processing performance is not selected as a governing contract for this runtime integration slice. | Performance-sensitive batch scheduling or large artifact handling enters scope. |
| Persistence And Migrations contract | Durable run record migration and persisted schema compatibility are not selected beyond existing run-state metadata alignment required by the sprint. | Durable runtime records, migrations, or stable persisted runtime schemas enter scope. |
