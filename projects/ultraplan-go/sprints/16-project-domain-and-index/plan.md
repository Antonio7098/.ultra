## Decisions To Execute

| Decision | Source Section | Execution Implication |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Own project behavior in `internal/project` | `reasoning.md#decision-1-own-project-behavior-in-internalproject` | Add focused project package files for domain, docs, discovery, store, index parsing, validation, and service use cases; keep project business rules out of `internal/app`, platform, study, and sprint modules. |
| Discover and resolve projects by direct safe names only | `reasoning.md#decision-2-discover-and-resolve-projects-by-direct-safe-names-only` | Scan only direct non-hidden directories under `projects/`, validate project names as safe path segments, sort results, and return actionable missing, invalid, or ambiguous reference diagnostics. |
| Read project files through a workspace-safe filesystem store | `reasoning.md#decision-3-read-project-files-through-a-workspace-safe-filesystem-store` | Read `docs/*.md`, `roadmap.md`, `project-index.md`, and direct sprint directory metadata through workspace-safe path helpers; keep status and validation bounded and read-only. |
| Parse current project-index catalog tables narrowly and validate findings structurally | `reasoning.md#decision-4-parse-current-project-index-catalog-tables-narrowly-and-validate-findings-structurally` | Implement a narrow parser for the current catalog sections and structured validation findings with section, entry name, path, problem, cause, severity, and suggested action. |
| Expose project commands as thin, deterministic, runtime-free CLI wiring | `reasoning.md#decision-5-expose-project-commands-as-thin-deterministic-runtime-free-cli-wiring` | Add `ultraplan project list`, `ultraplan project <project> status`, and `ultraplan project <project> validate`; handlers only parse, delegate, render stable text, and map exit codes. |
| Verify with fixture-first, command-level, review-protocol evidence | `reasoning.md#decision-6-verification-will-be-fixture-first-command-level-and-review-protocol-driven` | Add project package tests and app command tests, then record test, build, architecture, and sprint review evidence in `review.md` after implementation. |

## Requirements / Contracts To Satisfy

| Contract / Requirement ID | Required Behavior | Evidence Planned |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Architecture | Product behavior stays module-owned; `internal/project` owns project catalog behavior; `internal/app` stays thin; platform packages stay product-agnostic. | Import review, package placement review, command tests that exercise service delegation, and absence of prohibited packages. |
| Errors | Failures preserve causes internally and render safe actionable diagnostics with meaningful exit codes. | Unit tests for finding/error classification and command tests for stderr and exit code `5`. |
| Security | Workspace-managed paths are normalized; catalog path escapes fail closed; diagnostics avoid unsafe absolute-path leakage where possible. | Tests for `..` escapes, absolute escapes, missing paths, explicit external handling, and safe output. |
| Testing | Deterministic offline unit, fixture, and command tests cover domain and CLI behavior. | `internal/project/project_test.go`, `internal/app/project_commands_test.go`, `go test ./...`, and `go test -race ./...`. |
| Documentation | Package docs and CLI help describe ownership, commands, and catalog-only semantics. | `internal/project/doc.go`, top-level help tests, project help tests, and command-specific help tests. |
| CLI Surface | Project commands are stable, script-friendly, documented, and map validation failures to exit code `5`. | Command tests for help, output, stdout/stderr separation, deterministic ordering, and exit codes. |
| Performance | Discovery and status are bounded and avoid recursive source/evidence tree scans. | Tests with hidden, nested, file, and irrelevant entries plus code review for bounded scans. |
| AC-01, AC-02, AC-03 | Project list discovers direct project roots, ignores hidden/non-directory/nested entries, validates names, and sorts by name. | Discovery tests and `project list` command tests. |
| AC-04 | Project status reports docs, Markdown docs, `roadmap.md`, `project-index.md`, `sprints/`, and sprint directory health. | Project status unit tests and command output tests. |
| AC-05, AC-06 | Project validate exits `0` when valid and exit code `5` when required files, rows, paths, or path safety checks fail. | Validation unit tests and command tests for success/failure exit codes. |
| AC-07, AC-08, AC-09, AC-10 | Project-index parsing recognizes source documents, contracts, evidence reports, reasoning templates, and review protocols; paths are workspace-safe; project index is catalog-only. | Parser tests based on the real `project-index.md`, validation tests for missing/escaping paths, and package doc/help review. |
| AC-11, AC-12, AC-15, AC-18 | Project commands do not use study internals, runtime, agentwrap, network, workflow execution, or global catalog/validation/planning packages. | Import review, package review, command tests requiring no runtime fakes, and diff review for prohibited package creation. |
| AC-16, AC-17 | Tests cover named fixtures and help documents the project command family. | Fixture tests for valid/missing/malformed/path cases and help tests for top-level/project subcommands. |
| AC-19, AC-20, AC-21 | Offline tests, race tests, and CLI build pass from `/home/antonioborgerees/coding/ultraplan-go`. | `go test ./...`, `go test -race ./...`, and `go build ./cmd/ultraplan`. |

## Verification Commands

| Check | Command | Expected Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Offline tests | `go test ./...` from `/home/antonioborgerees/coding/ultraplan-go` | Passes without OpenCode, provider credentials, network access, Git commands, or long sleeps. |
| Race tests | `go test -race ./...` from `/home/antonioborgerees/coding/ultraplan-go` | Passes without data races. |
| CLI build | `go build ./cmd/ultraplan` from `/home/antonioborgerees/coding/ultraplan-go` | Builds the CLI binary successfully. |
| Help smoke | `ultraplan --help`, `ultraplan project --help`, `ultraplan project list --help`, `ultraplan project <project> status --help`, `ultraplan project <project> validate --help` | Help lists the project command family and subcommands. |
| Import review | Inspect imports for `internal/project`, `internal/app`, and platform packages | `internal/project` has no study/sprint/runtime/agentwrap/OpenCode imports; platform packages do not import product modules. |
| Package review | Inspect created packages | No global `internal/catalog`, `internal/validation`, `internal/reports`, `internal/prompts`, `internal/planning`, or workflow-engine package exists. |

## Risks And Blockers

| Risk / Blocker | Source | Mitigation | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Current `project-index.md` table shapes may not cover future variants. | `reasoning.md` assumption | Kept parser narrow, tested recognized current-format sections, and left future schema variants out of scope. | mitigated |
| Workspace path helpers may be missing or too study-specific. | `reasoning.md` assumption | Existing `workspace.ResolveInside` and `workspace.Rel` were sufficient; no new helper required. | closed |
| Project reference resolution behavior could be ambiguous if exact and prefix matching conventions differ from existing app patterns. | `reasoning.md` assumption | Matched existing study exact-then-prefix resolution style with deterministic missing/ambiguous diagnostics. | closed |
| External catalog entry modeling is underspecified. | `reasoning.md` risk | Implemented URL-like external detection only; workspace-relative and escaping paths fail closed. | mitigated |
| Status and validate could diverge if they duplicate catalog health logic. | `reasoning.md` risk | Status derives catalog health from the same validation path as validate. | closed |
| Text output may become automation-sensitive before JSON output is scoped. | `reasoning.md` risk | Text output is concise and covered by command tests; JSON schema remains deferred. | mitigated |
| Project commands could accidentally pull in study or runtime dependencies through app composition. | `reasoning.md` risk | Import review found no study, sprint, runtime, agentwrap, or OpenCode imports in `internal/project`. | closed |
| Diagnostics may leak absolute local paths. | `reasoning.md` risk | User-facing finding paths are catalog/workspace-relative; escape causes can include existing workspace helper detail. | mitigated |

## Open Questions To Resolve During Implementation

| Question | Source | Required Handling |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Are existing workspace path helpers sufficient for project and catalog path safety? | `reasoning.md` assumption | Inspect existing workspace APIs during implementation; add only generic helper behavior if needed and keep project semantics in `internal/project`. |
| What project reference resolution convention is already established by the CLI? | `reasoning.md` assumption | Follow existing exact/prefix behavior if present; otherwise implement exact plus deterministic unambiguous reference handling with clear missing/ambiguous diagnostics. |
| How should explicitly external catalog entries be identified? | `reasoning.md` risk | Support only clearly modeled external entries or URL-like references; fail closed for ambiguous workspace-escaping paths. |
| Should status reuse full catalog validation or a lighter shared health helper? | `reasoning.md` risk | Prefer one validation-backed source of truth so `status` and `validate` do not diverge. |
