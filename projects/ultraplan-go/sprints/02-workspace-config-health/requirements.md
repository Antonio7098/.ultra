# Sprint Requirements: Workspace, Config, Logging, and Health Skeleton

> Project: `ultraplan-go`
> Sprint: `02-workspace-config-health`
> Purpose: the authoritative, human-readable sprint contract. All other sprint artifacts must satisfy these requirements.

## Sprint Goal

Make UltraPlan able to find, initialize, inspect, and validate a workspace — establishing workspace discovery, config loading, logging foundation, and health command skeleton.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `go test ./...` succeeds from `../ultraplan-go` without requiring OpenCode, provider credentials, network access, or a configured UltraPlan workspace.
- [ ] `go build ./cmd/ultraplan` succeeds and produces a runnable CLI binary.
- [ ] `ultraplan init-workspace [--path <dir>] [--dry-run]` creates the required workspace structure if not present: `ultraplan.yml`, `prompts/base.md`, `prompts/synthesize.md`, `templates/repo-analysis.md`, `templates/report.md`, and `studies/`.
- [ ] `ultraplan config show [--json]` prints effective config with proper precedence and redacted sensitive values.
- [ ] `ultraplan health [--json]` reports basic workspace, config, filesystem, and environment status without requiring OpenCode or provider credentials.
- [ ] Config precedence is respected: built-in defaults < workspace config < environment variables < CLI flags.
- [ ] Secret redaction is implemented for sensitive config values.
- [ ] Text and JSON output modes are deterministic and supported for config and health commands.
- [ ] CLI help output includes init-workspace, config, and health commands.
- [ ] Exit codes are deterministic and meaningful per error class.

## Non-Goals

- Workspace validation beyond structural workspace/config/filesystem checks is not included.
- Config hot-reload is not included.
- Persistent workspace state beyond the initial scaffold is not included.
- Study listing, study initialization, source discovery, and analysis runs are not included.
- Runtime execution, agentwrap integration, OpenCode, and agent health checks are not included.
- Durable file logs, full structured log level policy, run event records, and observability event persistence are not included.
- Target scaffolding, sprint planning, and sprint execution workflows are not included.

## Constraints

- Use Go and the standard Go toolchain.
- Workspace discovery must follow the TRD precedence: explicit `--workspace`, `ULTRAPLAN_WORKSPACE`, current directory, then nearest parent directory.
- Config loading must follow the TRD precedence chain: built-in defaults → workspace config → environment variables → CLI flags.
- Secret values must be redacted in output, never logged or exposed.
- Keep `cmd/ultraplan/main.go` thin; all workspace/config/health logic lives under `internal/`.
- Platform packages must not import product modules.
- Tests must be deterministic and offline.
- CLI output must be script-friendly: deterministic text, JSON mode available, meaningful exit codes.

## Dependencies

| Prior Sprint / Output | Required For | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Sprint 1: CLI Foundation | Module layout, command routing baseline | Sprint 1 establishes the Go module, `cmd/ultraplan`, `internal/app`, and initial package layout that Sprint 2 extends with workspace/config behavior. |
| Architecture contract | Module ownership, dependency direction | Module-driven layout and thin entrypoints from architecture contract. |
| Errors contract | Exit codes, error wrapping, diagnostics | Exit code classes and error taxonomy from errors contract. |
| Configuration contract | Config precedence, redaction, validation | Config precedence chain and secret redaction requirements from configuration contract. |
| CLI Surface contract | Command shape, flags, help, output modes | Command surface expectations for init-workspace, config, health. |
| go-cli-study reports 01-15 | Evidence for implementation | Selected reports referenced in sprint-index.md. |

## Review Expectations

| What | How Verified |
| --- | --- |
| Buildability | Run `go build ./cmd/ultraplan` from `../ultraplan-go`. |
| Test pass | Run `go test ./...` from `../ultraplan-go`. |
| init-workspace command | Run with `--dry-run` first, then without; verify required workspace files and directories are created only inside the selected workspace path. |
| config show command | Run with text and `--json` output; verify defaults, workspace config, environment variables, and CLI flags resolve in the required order. |
| health command | Run with text and `--json` output; verify basic workspace/config/filesystem status reporting and no OpenCode/provider dependency. |
| Secret redaction | Verify sensitive values do not appear in output. |
| Exit codes | Run commands with invalid args or missing state; verify non-zero exit codes. |
| Scope control | Verify no study, target, sprint, runtime, or code extraction behavior was implemented. |
