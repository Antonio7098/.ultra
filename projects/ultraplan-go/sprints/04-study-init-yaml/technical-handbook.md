PRD, TRD, and Architecture documents were used only for sprint scope context. Evidence claims below are grounded in the selected evidence reports and their cited source references.

## Selected Studies And Reports

| Study / Report | Path | Relevant Finding | Confidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `01-project-structure` | `.ultra/studies/go-cli-study/reports/final/01-project-structure.md` | Mature Go CLIs keep entrypoints thin and put application behavior behind `cmd/` or `internal/` boundaries; examples include `cmd/restic/main.go:37-114`, `cmd/root.go:112-127`, and `cmd/gh/main.go:6`. | high |
| `02-command-architecture` | `.ultra/studies/go-cli-study/reports/final/02-command-architecture.md` | Factory-created commands with thin `RunE` handlers are common in maintainable CLIs; examples include `pkg/cmd/install.go:132-145`, `pkg/cmd/issue/list/list.go:47-118`, and `cmd/restic/main.go:37-114`. | high |
| `03-dependency-injection` | `.ultra/studies/go-cli-study/reports/final/03-dependency-injection.md` | Manual DI through factories, options, and explicit service boundaries is preferred over global state; examples include `pkg/cmdutil/factory.go:16-43`, `executor.go:22-24`, and `internal/app/app.go:42-81`. | high |
| `05-error-handling` | `.ultra/studies/go-cli-study/reports/final/05-error-handling.md` | Actionable CLI errors depend on wrapping, sentinels, typed errors, exit-code mapping, and user-facing hints; examples include `cmd/age/tui.go:37-54`, `go-task/errors/errors_task.go:13-32`, and `internal/ghcmd/cmd.go:44-49`. | high |
| `06-io-abstraction` | `.ultra/studies/go-cli-study/reports/final/06-io-abstraction.md` | Injectable writers, filesystem seams, and fake command boundaries improve command and file-operation tests; examples include `pkg/iostreams/iostreams.go:551-568`, `internal/fs/interface.go:10-31`, and `executor.go:553-564`. | high |
| `09-terminal-ux` | `.ultra/studies/go-cli-study/reports/final/09-terminal-ux.md` | CLI-first tools should prefer calm text output, non-TTY-safe behavior, and progress only when operations are long; relevant examples include `internal/cmd/prompt.go:20-256`, `lib/terminal/terminal.go:82-86`, and `internal/ui/terminal.go:10-34`. | medium |
| `11-testing-strategy` | `.ultra/studies/go-cli-study/reports/final/11-testing-strategy.md` | Strong CLI projects combine table-driven tests, integration-style command tests, mock/fake infrastructure, and golden or fixture outputs; examples include `internal/cmd/main_test.go:64-174`, `pkg/httpmock/stub.go:35-199`, and `internal/backend/mock/backend.go:14-26`. | high |
| `13-security` | `.ultra/studies/go-cli-study/reports/final/13-security.md` | External command execution and path-sensitive operations need explicit trust boundaries: argument arrays, safe executable lookup, validation, and secret redaction; examples include `internal/execext/exec.go:59-66`, `pkg/registry/transport.go:37-41`, and `pkg/surveyext/editor_manual.go:23`. | high |
| `15-philosophy` | `.ultra/studies/go-cli-study/reports/final/15-philosophy.md` | Durable CLIs intentionally reject scope, keep complexity near its benefit, and use interface/decorator patterns where dry-run, test, or backend flexibility requires them; examples include `internal/chezmoi/system.go:25-45`, `fs/types.go:16-59`, and `internal/backend/backend.go:19-90`. | high |

## Relevant Patterns

- **Thin CLI Wiring, Product Logic Elsewhere:** The evidence repeatedly separates command construction from business logic. `01-project-structure` cites `cmd/restic/main.go:37-114`, `cmd/root.go:112-127`, and `cmd/gh/main.go:6` as thin entrypoints, while `02-command-architecture` cites `pkg/cmd/install.go:132-145` delegating to action logic. For this sprint, this pattern pressures `internal/app` to parse flags and print results while YAML validation, planning, filesystem writes, rendering, and clone behavior stay in `internal/study`.
- **Factory Functions And Explicit Dependencies:** Command factories and DI factories keep command setup testable. `02-command-architecture` cites `pkg/cmd/issue/list/list.go:47-118`, `pkg/cmd/install.go:132`, and `cmd/restic/cmd_backup.go:35`; `03-dependency-injection` cites `pkg/cmdutil/factory.go:16-43` and `pkg/cmd/factory/default.go:26-46`. Sprint reasoning should decide how much construction belongs in the existing app composition root without creating a god object.
- **Narrow Interfaces At Volatile Boundaries:** Evidence favors interfaces for filesystem, external process, terminal, and backend boundaries rather than every helper. `06-io-abstraction` cites `internal/fs/interface.go:10-31`, `internal/backend/backend.go:19-90`, and `pkg/iostreams/iostreams.go:551-568`; `15-philosophy` cites `internal/chezmoi/system.go:25-45`. For this sprint, the volatile boundaries are writes and `git clone`, not pure normalization helpers.
- **Plan-Then-Execute For Dry Run And Force Safety:** Chezmoi-style System wrappers and decorator patterns support dry-run/debug behavior (`internal/chezmoi/system.go:25-45` in `15-philosophy`). Study init has similar pressure: one validated plan should drive both `--dry-run` output and real execution so the dry-run path does not drift from the mutation path.
- **Actionable, Classified Errors:** `05-error-handling` cites `%w` wrapping examples (`vfs/zip.go:21`, `pkg/ssh/ssh_keys.go:64`) and user hints (`cmd/age/tui.go:37-54`, `internal/ghcmd/cmd.go:281-301`). For this sprint, errors should name the YAML field, source item, dimension item, path, clone target, or overwrite condition and preserve cause chains for command-level exit mapping.
- **Partial Failure Visibility:** `05-error-handling` cites multi-error aggregation in `pkg/action/uninstall.go:232-254`, `internal/chezmoierrors/chezmoi errors.go:24`, and `internal/checker/checker.go:70-91`. Clone failures can happen after artifact creation, so sprint reasoning should account for returning a partial/failure status while still telling the user which generated files exist.
- **Non-Shell External Command Boundary:** `13-security` identifies argument arrays as the baseline for subprocess safety, citing `cmd_obj_builder.go:38`, `pkg/surveyext/editor_manual.go:23`, and `internal/execext/exec.go:59-66`. For `git clone --depth 1 <url> <dest>`, the sprint should keep command construction explicit and testable, avoiding `sh -c` or string concatenation.
- **Fixture And Fake-First Tests:** `11-testing-strategy` cites CLI integration via `internal/cmd/main_test.go:64-174`, command fakes like `lazygit/pkg/commands/oscommands/fake_cmd_obj_runner.go:17-26`, and HTTP/IO mocks such as `pkg/httpmock/stub.go:35-199`. Sprint tests should cover YAML parsing, planned artifacts, command output, force/dry-run, and clone calls without network or real GitHub access.
- **Human-Editable Generated Artifacts:** The philosophy report highlights simplicity and readable artifacts as long-lived maintenance choices, with filename-encoded metadata in `internal/chezmoi/chezmoi.go:36-58` and interface-backed dry-run wrappers in `internal/chezmoi/system.go:25-45`. For this sprint, normalized YAML and dimension Markdown should be deterministic and reviewable rather than opaque generated state.

## Trade-Offs

| Trade-Off | Benefit | Cost | When It Matters |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Explicit plan object before execution vs direct writes | Enables one validation path for dry-run and real init; makes force and path-safety review easier; mirrors decorator/dry-run evidence from `internal/chezmoi/system.go:25-45` | Adds an intermediate data structure and possible duplication between plan and renderer | Matters because `--dry-run`, `--force`, clone planning, and partial failures all need consistent output |
| Minimal clone runner interface vs broad process abstraction | A focused seam is easy to fake and keeps `git clone --depth 1` explicit; supported by command-runner fake evidence `fake_cmd_obj_runner.go:17-26` and argument-array evidence `cmd_obj_builder.go:38` | May need refactoring if later sprints add more external commands | Matters because this sprint only needs local `git`, not a general runtime/process framework |
| In-package `internal/study` files vs new subpackages | Keeps product behavior near study state and aligns with `internal/` application patterns (`cmd/restic/main.go:37-114`, `internal/restic/repository.go:18`) | A single package can grow large if future runtime, reports, and init logic are all mixed | Matters because requirements explicitly constrain study init behavior to `internal/study` and discourage global technical-layer packages |
| Golden/fixture output assertions vs flexible substring assertions | Golden-style comparisons catch accidental changes in README, YAML, and dimension Markdown; evidence includes `helm/internal/test/test.go:43` and `go-task/task_test.go:166-169` | Golden maintenance can slow iteration and produce noisy diffs | Matters for deterministic generated artifacts and command help/dry-run output |
| Typed/sentinel validation errors vs plain formatted errors | Supports exit-code mapping and user-specific messages; evidence includes `go-task/errors/errors.go:47-50`, `pkg/storage/driver/driver.go:27-36`, and `internal/ghcmd/cmd.go:44-49` | More error types to maintain for a small sprint | Matters for duplicate names, unsafe paths, count mismatch, existing output, and clone partial failure |
| Progress output vs quiet deterministic output | Progress can reassure users during long clone operations, as terminal UX evidence supports progress for operations over two seconds (`tui/progress.go:12-68`, `internal/ui/progress/`) | Progress complicates tests and non-TTY behavior | Matters only if cloning multiple repos can take long; dry-run and normal artifact writes should remain calm and script-friendly |

## Anti-Patterns And Warnings

- **Business Rules In `RunE`:** `02-command-architecture` flags long command bodies such as `cmd/root.go:49-183`, `cmd/age/age.go:105-321`, and `cmd/evaluate_sequence_command.go:152`. For this sprint, CLI handlers should not own YAML validation, path planning, artifact rendering, or clone execution policy.
- **Global Mutable Configuration Or IO:** `03-dependency-injection` warns about package-level config and singleton caches (`fs/config.go:793`, `fs/cache/cache.go:16-21`), while `06-io-abstraction` warns about direct `os.Stdout`/`os.Stderr` leaks (`cmd/ls/ls.go:42`, `cmd/age/tui.go:31`). Study init tests will be harder if output streams, workspace roots, or clone runners are hidden globals.
- **Shell String Construction For Clone:** `13-security` treats argument arrays as the baseline and warns against shell command strings. `git clone` should be invoked as executable plus args, not through `sh -c`, to avoid metacharacter interpretation in URLs or paths.
- **Panic For User YAML Or Parse Errors:** `05-error-handling` flags parse-time panics such as `dive/image/docker/manifest.go:18`. Invalid YAML, missing fields, duplicate dimensions, and unsafe names are user errors and should be returned as actionable validation failures.
- **Dry Run That Bypasses Validation:** If dry-run only prints intended paths without using the real planning/validation flow, it can miss path escape, duplicate, force, or count errors. This conflicts with the evidence-backed dry-run/decorator pressure from `internal/chezmoi/system.go:25-45`.
- **Unreviewable Generated Output:** Golden-output evidence exists because user-facing text and generated artifacts regress easily. Non-deterministic YAML ordering, absolute paths in normalized YAML, or generated Markdown that loses supplied steps/citations/questions would undermine the sprint goal.
- **Tests That Require Network Or Real Repositories:** `11-testing-strategy` warns against real external dependencies in unit tests. Clone behavior should use fakes, not GitHub, network, or actual cloned repositories.
- **Implementation-Detail Test Assertions:** The testing report warns about brittle UI-internal assertions like `internal/view/pod_test.go:23`. For this sprint, tests should assert generated files, content, clone args, exit behavior, and user output rather than private map sizes or helper call counts.

## Examples Worth Inspecting

| Example | Path / Source | Why It Is Useful |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Thin command-to-action delegation | `helm/pkg/cmd/install.go:132-145`, `helm/pkg/action/install.go:73-140` | Shows how command code can collect flags and delegate actual operation to a non-CLI action layer. |
| Factory with testable dependencies | `gh-cli/pkg/cmdutil/factory.go:16-43`, `gh-cli/pkg/cmd/factory/default.go:26-46` | Useful when deciding how the app composition root supplies IO, workspace, and study services to `study init`. |
| IO test constructor | `gh-cli/pkg/iostreams/iostreams.go:551-568` | Shows a simple shape for command tests that capture stdout/stderr without real terminals. |
| Filesystem interface and mock terminal | `restic/internal/fs/interface.go:10-31`, `restic/internal/ui/mock.go:10-53` | Useful for reasoning about how much filesystem abstraction is warranted for artifact generation tests. |
| Dry-run/debug filesystem wrapper | `chezmoi/internal/chezmoi/system.go:25-45` | Shows a pattern where write-like behavior can be wrapped for dry-run/read-only/debug modes. |
| Actionable hint errors | `age/cmd/age/tui.go:37-54`, `gh-cli/internal/ghcmd/cmd.go:281-301` | Useful for validation errors that should tell users exactly which YAML field or path to fix. |
| Multi-error or partial failure aggregation | `helm/pkg/action/uninstall.go:232-254`, `restic/internal/checker/checker.go:70-91` | Relevant to clone failures after successful artifact writes. |
| Command runner fake | `lazygit/pkg/commands/oscommands/fake_cmd_obj_runner.go:17-26` | Useful for testing clone planning and execution without network or Git. |
| Argument-array command execution | `go-task/internal/execext/exec.go:59-66`, `lazygit/cmd_obj_builder.go:38` | Useful for keeping `git clone` non-shell and injection-resistant. |
| Golden/fixture test infrastructure | `helm/internal/test/test.go:43`, `go-task/task_test.go:166-169` | Useful for deterministic README, normalized YAML, dimension Markdown, help, and dry-run output assertions. |

## Design Pressures

- Keep study initialization owned by `internal/study` while `internal/app` remains a command and output wiring layer.
- Support a single deterministic planning path that feeds validation, dry-run, force checks, artifact writes, and clone planning.
- Preserve human editability: generated dimension Markdown, `README.md`, and normalized `study-init.yml` should remain reviewable and stable.
- Treat YAML files, source names, dimension names, URLs, and output paths as untrusted input that must be normalized and validated before write or clone execution.
- Keep `git clone` behind a small fakeable boundary with explicit arg arrays and no shell interpolation.
- Make clone partial failure visible without hiding successful artifact creation.
- Avoid runtime-assisted completion and source URL repair paths in this sprint, even though broader docs mention them as future scope.
- Prefer behavior-focused unit and command tests that do not need network, GitHub, OpenCode, provider credentials, or real cloned repositories.
- Decide how much output polish is useful without adding interactive UX, spinners, or TUI dependencies to a batch-style init command.
- Keep generated paths relative and workspace-scoped unless an explicitly selected output root requires different diagnostics.

## Open Questions For Reasoning

- What is the minimal `internal/study` service API that keeps CLI handlers thin while avoiding a large generic service container?
- Should planning produce an explicit list of directories, files, and clone actions as a public internal type, or should this stay private to `InitStudy`?
- What exact fields should a study initialization validation error expose so command output can name YAML paths such as `repos.items[1].name` and `dimensions.items[0].number`?
- How should partial clone failure be represented under existing CLI exit-code conventions: a typed partial error, a result status plus error, or a joined error?
- What generated files may `--force` overwrite, and should it ever remove unknown files inside the study directory or only overwrite known generated paths?
- How should `--output <dir>` interact with workspace path safety and normalized YAML paths?
- Should clone actions be executed after all file writes complete, or interleaved with source directory creation, given the requirement to report successful artifact creation when clones fail?
- Is a filesystem abstraction needed for all artifact writes, or are temp directories plus a small writer/planner seam sufficient for this sprint?
- Which generated outputs deserve golden assertions versus direct structured assertions to balance determinism with maintenance cost?
- What user-facing wording should explain that `repos.count` or `dimensions.count` greater than explicit items is unsupported until assisted completion enters scope?
