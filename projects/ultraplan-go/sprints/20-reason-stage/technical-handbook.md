## Selected Studies And Reports

| Study / Report | Path | Relevant Finding | Confidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `01-project-structure` | `.ultra/studies/go-cli-study/reports/final/01-project-structure.md` | Non-trivial Go CLIs keep entrypoints thin and route work inward: chezmoi `main.go:26-34`, gh-cli `cmd/gh/main.go:6`, k9s `cmd/root.go:112-127`, restic `cmd/restic/main.go:37-114`; `internal/` boundaries are used for application-owned behavior such as chezmoi `internal/chezmoi/chezmoi.go:1-2` and restic `internal/restic/repository.go:18`. | high |
| `02-command-architecture` | `.ultra/studies/go-cli-study/reports/final/02-command-architecture.md` | Mature command trees use factory functions and delegate from command handlers: gh-cli `pkg/cmdutil/factory.go:16-43`, helm `pkg/cmd/install.go:132-145`, restic `cmd/restic/main.go:37-114`; large `RunE` handlers are a warning, such as opencode `cmd/root.go:49-183`. | high |
| `03-dependency-injection` | `.ultra/studies/go-cli-study/reports/final/03-dependency-injection.md` | Manual composition roots, constructor injection, functional options, and small interfaces dominate over DI frameworks: gh-cli `pkg/cmd/factory/default.go:26-46`, go-task `executor.go:22-24`, helm `pkg/action/action.go:118-146`, opencode `internal/app/app.go:42-81`. | high |
| `04-configuration-management` | `.ultra/studies/go-cli-study/reports/final/04-configuration-management.md` | Config quality depends on explicit precedence and post-merge validation: chezmoi restores changed flags after config load at `internal/cmd/config.go:2253-2287`, go-task centralizes generic precedence at `internal/flags/flags.go:314-327`, opencode validates centrally at `internal/config/config.go:609-641`. | high |
| `05-error-handling` | `.ultra/studies/go-cli-study/reports/final/05-error-handling.md` | Strong CLIs wrap errors with `%w`, use sentinels or typed errors for classification, and separate user-facing messages from operational details: rclone `fs/fserrors/error.go:22-29`, go-task `errors/errors.go:47-50`, restic `internal/errors/fatal.go:10`, gh-cli `internal/ghcmd/cmd.go:44-49`. | high |
| `06-io-abstraction` | `.ultra/studies/go-cli-study/reports/final/06-io-abstraction.md` | Testable CLIs inject stdout, stderr, filesystem, and runtime-like boundaries rather than hardcoding `os.*`: gh-cli `pkg/iostreams/iostreams.go:551-568`, go-task `executor.go:541-577`, restic `internal/ui/terminal.go:10-36`, chezmoi `internal/chezmoi/system.go:25`. | high |
| `07-state-context` | `.ultra/studies/go-cli-study/reports/final/07-state-context.md` | Long or cancellable workflows create a root context and pass it through I/O and work layers; state is commonly centralized in an app/config/executor object: gh-cli `internal/ghcmd/cmd.go:142`, go-task `task.go:89`, helm `pkg/cmd/install.go:333-347`, opencode `internal/session/session.go:12-23`. | medium |
| `09-terminal-ux` | `.ultra/studies/go-cli-study/reports/final/09-terminal-ux.md` | Scriptable CLI UX favors non-TTY fallbacks, clean cancellation, and restrained progress. Relevant evidence includes chezmoi non-TTY prompt handling at `internal/cmd/prompt.go:20-256`, gh-cli prompter checks in `internal/prompter/`, and go-task signal handling at `signals.go:11-31`. | medium |
| `10-logging-observability` | `.ultra/studies/go-cli-study/reports/final/10-logging-observability.md` | Operationally useful CLIs keep stdout for user/data output and stderr or files for diagnostics, with structured logging where useful: helm `internal/logging/logging.go:31-66`, k9s `internal/slogs/keys.go:6-231`, gh-cli `pkg/iostreams/iostreams.go:52-54`, rclone `fs/log/slog.go:21`. | high |
| `11-testing-strategy` | `.ultra/studies/go-cli-study/reports/final/11-testing-strategy.md` | High-confidence CLI changes use table tests, fake seams, command-level or testscript integration, golden output where stable, and fixture-driven validation: chezmoi `internal/cmd/main_test.go:64-174`, gh-cli `acceptance/acceptance_test.go:26-29`, helm `internal/test/test.go:43`, go-task `task_test.go:166-169`. | high |
| `13-security` | `.ultra/studies/go-cli-study/reports/final/13-security.md` | Security-relevant CLI work marks trust boundaries explicitly, avoids shell/string command construction, redacts secrets, and validates untrusted config: opencode `internal/permission/permission.go:44-108`, opencode `internal/llm/tools/bash.go:41-55`, restic `internal/options/secret_string.go:15-20`, helm `pkg/registry/transport.go:37-41`, k9s `internal/config/json/validator.go:146`. | high |
| `15-philosophy` | `.ultra/studies/go-cli-study/reports/final/15-philosophy.md` | Coherent projects accept complexity deliberately and reject scope that does not serve the core workflow. Relevant patterns include gh-cli factory wiring `pkg/cmd/factory/default.go:26-46`, restic backend interfaces `internal/backend/backend.go:19-90`, opencode pub/sub `internal/pubsub/broker.go:10-19`, and go-task experiments `website/src/docs/experiments/index.md:17-21`. | medium |

## Relevant Patterns

- **Thin CLI, sprint-owned behavior:** The CLI layer should remain command parsing, output rendering, exit-code mapping, and service delegation. This is supported by project-structure evidence from chezmoi `main.go:26-34`, gh-cli `cmd/gh/main.go:6`, and k9s `cmd/root.go:112-127`, plus command-architecture evidence from helm `pkg/cmd/install.go:132-145` and gh-cli `pkg/cmdutil/factory.go:16-43`. For this sprint, the pressure is to keep reason-stage rules near sprint planning state rather than in command handlers.

- **Module boundary via `internal/` and unidirectional imports:** Application projects use `internal/` to protect private behavior and keep import flow one-way. Evidence includes chezmoi `internal/chezmoi/chezmoi.go:1-2`, restic `internal/restic/repository.go:18`, yq `cmd/root.go:9`, and yq `cmd/evaluate_sequence_command.go:7`. For this sprint, the pattern argues for preserving product module ownership and avoiding reverse imports from platform code into sprint behavior.

- **Manual composition root with explicit seams:** Mature CLIs avoid reflection-based DI and instead wire dependencies through factories, constructors, functional options, and app/config structs. Evidence includes gh-cli `pkg/cmd/factory/default.go:26-46`, go-task `executor.go:22-24`, helm `pkg/action/action.go:118-146`, and opencode `internal/app/app.go:42-81`. This matters for fake runtime, fake filesystem, clock, and IO seams in reason-stage tests.

- **Injectable IO for command testability:** CLI output should flow through injected writers or UI abstractions so tests can verify stdout, stderr, and no-ANSI behavior. Evidence includes gh-cli `pkg/iostreams/iostreams.go:551-568`, go-task `executor.go:541-577`, mitchellh-cli `ui.go:19-43`, restic `internal/ui/terminal.go:10-36`, and gdu `stdout/stdout.go:45-58`.

- **Explicit validation gates after generation:** Error-handling and testing reports both favor behavior where successful execution is not enough; outputs and state must be checked. Evidence is indirect but consistent: typed/exit-code errors in go-task `errors/errors.go:47-50`, fatal classification in restic `internal/errors/fatal.go:10`, command lifecycle tests in chezmoi `internal/cmd/main_test.go:64-174`, and golden/fixture checks in helm `internal/test/test.go:43`. This pattern applies to runtime-backed reasoning generation only as a caution: sprint reasoning must decide exactly how validation gates and state updates compose.

- **Context propagation for long or runtime-backed work:** Long operations create an entry context and pass it through execution layers, with signal cancellation when appropriate. Evidence includes gh-cli `internal/ghcmd/cmd.go:142`, go-task `task.go:89`, helm `pkg/cmd/install.go:333-347`, and restic `cmd/restic/cleanup.go:24-38`. For this sprint, this supports treating runtime-backed flow differently from dry-run validate/prompt paths while keeping cancellation explicit.

- **Structured, safe diagnostics with stdout/stderr separation:** Logging evidence favors structured diagnostic paths and strict separation from user output. Evidence includes helm `internal/logging/logging.go:31-66`, gh-cli `pkg/iostreams/iostreams.go:52-54`, yq `pkg/yqlib/logger.go:5`, and rclone `fs/log/slog.go:21`. This pattern matters for validation findings, prompt previews, dry-run output, and runtime errors.

- **Security boundaries around commands, paths, and secrets:** Security evidence favors explicit trust boundaries, redaction types, and no stringly shell execution. Evidence includes opencode permission checks in `internal/permission/permission.go:44-108`, opencode command filtering in `internal/llm/tools/bash.go:41-55`, restic `SecretString` in `internal/options/secret_string.go:15-20`, helm auth-header scrubbing in `pkg/registry/transport.go:37-41`, and k9s config schema validation in `internal/config/json/validator.go:146`.

## Trade-Offs

| Trade-Off | Benefit | Cost | When It Matters |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Keep reason-stage behavior inside `internal/sprint` vs extract generic planning/workflow packages | Preserves module-owned behavior, mirrors `internal/` application boundaries from chezmoi `internal/chezmoi/chezmoi.go:1-2` and restic `internal/restic/repository.go:18`, and reduces premature abstraction | Some duplicated mechanics may remain until repeated needs are proven | When deciding where selected-template parsing, prompt rendering, validation, and flow-state transitions live |
| Command factories and service methods vs larger command handlers | Improves testability and keeps CLI wiring thin, following gh-cli `pkg/cmdutil/factory.go:16-43`, helm `pkg/cmd/install.go:132-145`, and restic `cmd/restic/main.go:37-114` | More small request/response types or constructor arguments may be needed | When adding `validate`, `prompt`, and `flow --to reasoning` support |
| Interface/fake seams vs concrete direct calls | Enables fake runtime, buffer-based output checks, and filesystem/path tests, matching gh-cli `pkg/iostreams/iostreams.go:551-568`, restic `internal/backend/mock/backend.go:14-26`, and go-task `executor.go:541-577` | Too many interfaces can obscure simple code and create maintenance overhead | When choosing seams for runtime, store, clock, filesystem, and IO |
| Strict validation before state completion vs permissive artifact existence checks | Reduces false success and supports actionable repair, aligning with typed error and test evidence such as go-task `errors/errors.go:47-50`, restic `internal/errors/fatal.go:10`, and testscript/golden practices in chezmoi `internal/cmd/main_test.go:64-174` | Validators can become brittle if they overfit prose or enforce implementation plans rather than artifact contract | When defining area reasoning and final reasoning validators |
| Non-interactive scriptable UX vs rich terminal feedback | Keeps prompt previews, dry-runs, and validations stable for automation, supported by IOStreams and non-TTY fallback evidence from gh-cli `pkg/iostreams/iostreams.go:52-54` and chezmoi `internal/cmd/prompt.go:20-256` | Less visually rich during runtime-backed generation | When designing output for validation, prompt preview, dry-run, and failure summaries |
| Context propagation everywhere vs only where work can block | Context on runtime-backed flow enables cancellation and timeouts, as in helm `pkg/cmd/install.go:333-347` and go-task `task.go:89` | Passing context through purely deterministic parsing/rendering helpers can add noise | When separating validate/prompt code paths from runtime-backed flow |

## Anti-Patterns And Warnings

- **Do not let command handlers own reasoning business rules:** Command-architecture evidence flags large handlers as a maintainability smell, including opencode `cmd/root.go:49-183`, yq `cmd/evaluate_sequence_command.go:152`, and restic `cmd/restic/cmd_backup.go:84-115` plus the report warning about `runBackup()` length. CLI wiring should not become the reason-stage workflow.

- **Do not introduce global mutable config, runtime, prompt, or validation state:** Dependency and configuration reports warn about globals such as rclone `fs/config.go:793`, yq `pkg/yqlib/lib.go:13`, yq `pkg/yqlib/yaml.go:40`, and opencode `internal/config/config.go:123`. Reason-stage behavior should remain constructable per test and per command invocation.

- **Do not hardcode stdout, stderr, filesystem, runtime, or external command access inside domain logic:** IO evidence flags direct `os.Stdout` and `os.Stderr` usage as testability leaks: rclone `cmd/ls/ls.go:42`, age `cmd/age/tui.go:31`, urfave-cli `cli.go:47`, and yq `pkg/yqlib/logger.go:18`. This sprint has prompt preview and diagnostic requirements that need injectable IO.

- **Do not bypass error wrapping or collapse all failures into unstructured strings:** Error evidence flags non-wrapping and magic exit codes as caution signs, including mitchellh-cli `cli.go:205-206` and `command.go:10-11`. Reason-stage validation and flow errors need cause preservation plus scriptable exit-code mapping.

- **Do not treat runtime success as artifact success:** Error and testing evidence supports explicit classification and output verification. A successful external process without expected files is a false positive; the handbook defers exact rules to reasoning, but warns against state completion without validated artifact existence and content.

- **Do not invoke shell, Git, OpenCode, provider APIs, or agent adapters from sprint domain code directly:** Security evidence favors explicit permission and safe execution boundaries, such as opencode `internal/llm/tools/bash.go:41-55` and gh-cli `pkg/surveyext/editor_manual.go:23`. For this sprint, direct side-effectful calls would cross the selected trust boundary.

- **Do not validate by brittle prose or internal counts:** Testing evidence warns against implementation-detail assertions such as k9s `internal/view/pod_test.go:23` and fragile regex output matching in gh-cli `pkg/cmd/issue/list/list_test.go:88-91`. Reasoning validators should check required artifact contract, selected-context constraints, and placeholders without requiring exact generated wording.

- **Do not allow unselected context to leak into decisions:** The selected-evidence process exists to constrain evidence. Security and configuration reports reinforce explicit input boundaries through k9s `internal/config/json/validator.go:146` and yq `pkg/yqlib/security_prefs.go:3-7`; the sprint-specific equivalent is rejecting unselected contracts, evidence, templates, protocols, and paths as decision sources.

## Examples Worth Inspecting

| Example | Path / Source | Why It Is Useful |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Thin entrypoint and inward delegation | chezmoi `main.go:26-34`; gh-cli `cmd/gh/main.go:6`; k9s `cmd/root.go:112-127` | Shows how command entrypoints avoid owning business rules. |
| Command factory with injected dependencies | gh-cli `pkg/cmdutil/factory.go:16-43`; helm `pkg/cmd/install.go:132-145`; restic `cmd/restic/main.go:37-114` | Useful for reasoning about sprint command wiring without embedding validation or flow logic in CLI handlers. |
| Functional options for testable services | go-task `executor.go:22-24`; go-task `executor.go:541-577` | Shows a Go-native way to configure optional seams, including IO. |
| IOStreams test constructor | gh-cli `pkg/iostreams/iostreams.go:551-568` | Strong reference for command tests that assert stdout/stderr behavior. |
| Filesystem abstraction | chezmoi `internal/chezmoi/system.go:25`; restic `internal/fs/interface.go:10-31` | Useful for workspace-safe store testing and path validation. |
| Error classification and exit mapping | gh-cli `internal/ghcmd/cmd.go:44-49`; go-task `errors/errors.go:47-50`; restic `internal/errors/fatal.go:10` | Relevant to validation failures, unsupported stages, and runtime failures. |
| Context cancellation around long operations | helm `pkg/cmd/install.go:333-347`; go-task `task.go:89`; restic `cmd/restic/cleanup.go:24-38` | Useful when reasoning about runtime-backed flow cancellation and dry-run separation. |
| Prompt/non-TTY fallback discipline | chezmoi `internal/cmd/prompt.go:20-256`; gh-cli `internal/prompter/` | Relevant to prompt preview and no-interactive default behavior. |
| Structured logging and diagnostic routing | helm `internal/logging/logging.go:31-66`; k9s `internal/slogs/keys.go:6-231`; gh-cli `pkg/iostreams/iostreams.go:52-54` | Useful for safe validation diagnostics and runtime error reporting. |
| Security boundary for agent-like commands | opencode `internal/permission/permission.go:44-108`; opencode `internal/llm/tools/bash.go:41-55` | Useful as a contrast: reason-stage code should not recreate agent permission or shell behavior. |
| Secret redaction | restic `internal/options/secret_string.go:15-20`; helm `pkg/registry/transport.go:37-41` | Useful for prompt previews, config summaries, and diagnostic safety. |
| Golden and script-style CLI tests | chezmoi `internal/cmd/main_test.go:64-174`; helm `internal/test/test.go:43`; go-task `task_test.go:166-169` | Useful for command behavior and output regression tests. |

## Design Pressures

- The sprint has two modes with different risk profiles: deterministic validate/prompt/dry-run paths and runtime-backed flow paths.

- Reasoning artifacts are editable Markdown, but validators must still reject missing sections, placeholders, unselected context, and absent prerequisites.

- Selected templates create a conditional stage: area reasoning may be required, or may be skipped only when no templates are selected.

- The command surface must stay scriptable, deterministic, stdout/stderr separated, and no-ANSI by default.

- Runtime-backed generation must be observable enough to diagnose failure without leaking secrets or raw sensitive runtime/config payloads.

- `flow-state.json` is durable state, so completion should represent validated facts, not intention or runtime return code alone.

- Workspace paths and selected template/report paths are trust boundaries; path escape, unreadable selected files, and unselected references need clear diagnostics.

- The sprint must reuse infrastructure carefully: workspace safety, config/redaction, generic runtime, and atomic files are plausible reuse points; study report semantics and run-loop scheduling are not evidence-supported reuse points for planning.

- Tests need to cover behavior through command, service, validator, store, fake runtime, and state seams without invoking real runtime, network, Git, or shell by default.

- Prompt rendering has evidence pressure from configuration, security, and terminal UX reports: include enough context to guide runtime output, but do not include secrets, unnecessary absolute paths, or mutation permission beyond expected output.

## Open Questions For Reasoning

- What exact internal model should represent selected reasoning templates and their deterministic output paths without turning `project-index.md` parsing into a new generic catalog package?

- Where is the smallest correct seam between `internal/app` command handlers and `internal/sprint` service methods for `validate area-reasoning`, `validate reasoning`, `prompt area-reasoning`, `prompt reasoning`, and `flow --to reasoning`?

- How strict should Markdown reasoning validation be so it catches placeholders, missing decisions, missing trade-offs, missing expected evidence, and unselected-context references without becoming brittle prose matching?

- What diagnostics shape gives users actionable file/path/section information while preserving cause chains and exit-code mapping?

- How should flow-state represent selected area reasoning completion, skipped area reasoning, final reasoning completion, and failure without accepting deferred implementation/smoke/review/issues stages?

- Which dependencies need interfaces or fakes now, and which should remain concrete until a second implementation proves the need?

- How should prompt rendering summarize selected contracts and selected evidence without treating unselected governance docs as evidence or copying too much source material into prompts?

- What validation order best prevents runtime work when prerequisites are invalid: requirements, sprint-index, project-index subset checks, handbook, selected templates, then area/final reasoning?

- How should unsupported stages fail: stage parser rejection, validation failure, flow preflight failure, or a shared stage validation helper?

- What minimum command tests prove prompt and validate paths do not invoke runtime, and flow paths invoke only the generic fake runtime seam?
